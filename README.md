# Description
A repo for me to begin exploring the upgrades between Java 8 and Java 17 (LTS).
I am also trying out [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io) for the cases when you are working on multiple old and new repositories and need to switch versions on the fly.

## To Compile (for now)
1) ➜ exploring-java-version-8-vs-17 git:(main) ✗ `javac hello-world-8/HelloWorldEight/HelloWorldEight.java`

## To Run (for now)
➜ exploring-java-version-8-vs-17 git:(main) ✗  `java hello-world-8/HelloWorldEight/HelloWorldEight.java Bob`  
This is one way to say "Hello Bob!" in Java Eight

## Testing
